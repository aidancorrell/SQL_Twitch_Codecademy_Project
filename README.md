# SQL_Twitch_Codecademy_Project
SQL Analysis of faux Twitch streaming data as a project in my Codecademy course

The data used here was supplied by Twitch via a Codecademy course I took. Many of the queries are a result of what was taught in the course. A link to the source files can be found here: https://github.com/sonnynomnom/Codecademy-Learn-SQL-from-Scratch/tree/master/Twitch
